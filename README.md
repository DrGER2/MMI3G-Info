# MMI3G-Info
MMI3G Information Report Script

Use this script to report on the state of Harman-Becker MMI3G, MMI3GP, and RNS-850 infotainment systems.
Includes running processes and mounted filesystems.

Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to a blank FAT32 SD card directly.
Start the system and allow all functions (CAR, MEDIA, NAV, RADIO, TEL) to start fully (usually after about 3 minutes).
Insert the SD card into an open SD slot.  Do not eject the SD card until prompted on the console display.
The script can take up to 10 minutes to complete when all report sections are set to 'Y', depending on the state of the HDD.
When the script is ended and ejected, inspect the SD card contents for the LOG file.
